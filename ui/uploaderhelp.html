        <h1>Adding resources</h1>
        <ul>
            <!--li>Drag and drop files directly into the viewer, or use the add button to select files to add. You can select multiple files by holding down the shift (continuous) or command/control (individual) keys</li-->
            <li>Use the add button to select a file to add.</li>
            <li>Select 'Upload' to begin the upload process. When all files have finished uploading, the upload progress window will close, and the files will be selected in the viewer, then you will be able to edit the associated metadata.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Editing resource metadata</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that one or more resources are selected.</li>
            <li>Edit the resource metadata properties in the editor displayed in the sidebar to the right. Information about the size, original file name and upload date for the associated file is also displayed.</li>
            <li>When a single resource is selected, all metadata properties will be updated when you select 'Save'.</li>
            <li>When multiple resources are selected, you can set the value of specific properties for all selected resources by
                 selecting the checkbox next to a property, editing the property value and then selecting 'Save All'.</li>
            <li>To reset the values back to the most recently stored values, select 'Cancel'.</li>
            <li>Use the configure button at the bottom left of the editor to select the properties to display in the editor. Note that this setting controls which properties are displayed in the editor and not which values are stored - properties that are not displayed may have stored values. To remove a property, first ensure that the property is displayed in the editor and then edit it so that the value is blank.</li>
            <li>You can rotate selected images using the rotate buttons at the top of the editor. This operation has no effect on resources that are not images. Select 'Save' or 'Save All' to apply the rotation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Selecting resources</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on a thumbnail to select a single resource.</li>
            <li>To select multiple resources, hold down shift (continuous) 
            or command/control (individual) and click to select. 
            To deselect a resource, hold down command/control and click that resource.</li>
            <li>Use the filter field to display only those images with matching titles or file names.</li>
            <li>Use the sort field to temporarily re-order the resources displayed, by date, title etc.</li>
            <li>You can display a larger preview of a resource by double clicking on the resource thumbnail.</li>

        </ul>
        <h1>Fullscreen mode</h1>
        <p>On small screens and tablets, you may wish to maximise the upload application to use the entire browser window. Use the button at the top-right of the toolbar to toggle the upload application between fullscreen and regular size.</p>
        <p>You may configure whether tools are launched in full screen mode by default by editing the preference stored in your <a href="/user">profile</a>.</p>
